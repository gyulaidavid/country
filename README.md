# Introduction 

I arrived at IT-field after a career change. ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyulaidavid "LinkedIn")) This is *my first Pet project*, which I am constantly developing. The project contains HTML, CSS, JS and React. I am learning to structure my components and also focusing on clean coding. On the other hand, my intention was to implement the most popular approaches and best practices.

Throughout this application you can arrange, filter the countries. You are able to search the official name of a country and also filter by population. Click the “Show more” button to get more details.

## Under construction :thinking: :
This application is not ready yet. I am working on it continuously. 
I would like to add:
- Firebase authentication, database
- React Router (favorite page)
- Detailed page of the countries
- Favorite page after login. 

## Key Topics
Framework: React

#### HTML and CSS:
I utilize Flexbox to present the usage of it.

#### React:
Usage of Hooks and functions (map, filter, sort).

#### Material UI:
Site building and formatting.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
