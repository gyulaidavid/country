# Introduction 

While studying geography with my son, I realized that an app with various data could enhance his interest in countries. The project's name emphasizes that behind the name of a country, there are many aspects to explore. Throughout this application, you can arrange and filter countries by population. You can also search for a country's official name and filter countries by region to get closer to your neighbors. Clicking on the 'Show more' button provides more details, and clicking on the name of a country allows you to dive deeper into the data.

My future plan is to add, read, and delete favorite countries on a personal page using Firebase. The first steps are available in the auth branch. I arrived in the IT field after a career change (as seen on LinkedIn). This is my first pet project, which I am constantly developing. The project contains HTML, CSS, JS, and React. I am learning to structure my components while focusing on clean coding. My intention is to implement the most popular approaches and best practices.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
